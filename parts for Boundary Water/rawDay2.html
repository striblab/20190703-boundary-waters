  <p class="drop-caps Text_Body">The balance of our first-day on the eastern border lakes paddle passed with ease, down the middle of South Lake with the wind at our backs. But challenges lay ahead.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">Brad Shannon, my friend and longtime Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCA) guide didn’t like the looks of the first two campsites we surveyed, but he approved the last one on the lake, on a rocky promontory alongside the portage to Rat Lake.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">Being our first night together, we hadn’t yet assumed our setup roles, so it took a while to erect tents, hang a tarp, and sling a hammock and rainfly between two trees. Our load included two personal portage packs (one shared by Brad, my son Aidan, and me, and the other shared by Star Tribune journalists Bob Timmons and Aaron Lavinsky); a food pack; an equipment pack; a stove pack; a knapsack full of fishing gear; a saddlebag of kibble for my yellow Lab, Crosby; and all of Aaron’s photo and video gear.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">With camp set, Aidan, 14, pushed off in a canoe to fish — that kid is crazy about fishing. I extracted from the food pack a first-night luxury: five T-bone steaks that I’d procured in the Twin Cities, vacuum-sealed, and frozen. Brad added some charcoal to the pack as well. And then Aidan paddled back to camp with two smallmouth bass, which he proceeded to fillet. This was going to be a banquet.</p>

  <p class="Text_Body">Then someone said, “That sky in the West doesn’t look so good.” The same wind that had been our ally all day now carried dark clouds, lightning, and thunder.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">Our wood fire stoked hot, we dumped the charcoal on the embers. “I think we’ll get dinner in before the storm hits,” Brad said without confidence, donning his rain gear. As he pushed sliced potatoes and onions around an overflowing Bethany skillet, I laid the first two steaks on the US Forest Service fire grate. And the skies opened.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">Raindrops sizzled on the grate as they hit next to the steaks. Brad occasionally pulled a potato slice out of the skillet, bit into it, and declared it not-yet-done. I pulled the first two steaks off the fire and plated them. As I dropped the remaining three on the grate, someone yelled at Crosby — he’d pulled the first two off a plate to the side and into the mud. I said that Aidan and I would eat those, which we did, standing in the downpour.</p>

  <p class="Text_Body">The storm passed, as storms do, giving way to an awe-inspiring sunset. However, everything was wet, including Aidan’s hammock, so he climbed into the tent between Brad and me and the dog. If I slept that night, I don’t remember it.</p>
  <strib type="text" data="&lt;div class='related-caption articleReefer'&gt;&lt;h4&gt;RELATED&nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class='areefer'&gt;&lt;a target='new' href='/x/512743502'&gt;Wisdom:&lt;/a&gt; Nail down your trip plans by asking the right questions first.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"></strib>
  <p class="Text_Body">We awoke with the sun and started water for coffee. After pancakes and applesauce, we went about the unsavory task of rolling up and packing wet gear. Today promised to be a relatively easy day, with a paddle of less than one-third of the 15 miles we’d put behind us on day one, and two short portages. Our goal was Rose Lake, famous for Stairway Portage, gorgeous vistas, and epic walleye fishing. We’d even been tipped off to a premiere campsite on the southwest corner of the lake, allowing easy access to a walleye hole.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">We came out of the long straits on the west end of Rose into a formidable headwind. Almost immediately, we crossed paths with another canoe with two paddlers, the first we’d seen, and then another. Even though it was only 10 a.m., I figured we’d better hustle to grab our preferred site, so we paddled a bit harder. But it was to no avail. When we got there, a young couple was perched on a rock, an upturned canoe by their side. When I asked, they affirmed that they were staying for the night.</p>

  <p class="Text_Body">So we turned up the lake, into the wind. With five more campsites on Rose Lake, I was unconcerned. But the next one was occupied, and the next, and the next. When we got to the last site on the lake, also unavailable, we faced a daunting dilemma: we could either cross the border that runs mid-lake and camp (illegally) in Canada, or we could tackle Long Portage, a 660-rod beast — just more than 2 miles — that we all feared, and after which we’d have to paddle at least four more miles to find a site.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">As we were gunnelled-up, discussing our options, a voice came from shore. “Hey, we decided that we’re leaving. You can have this site.” Relief washed over me, as I had been considering how to inspire my already exhausted teenager to put in many more hours of portaging and paddling.</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">We pulled our canoes to shore and stood in knee-deep water as we waited for the previous tenants to vacate the site. As the young men and women finally pushed off and we thanked them, one of them said, “We were told to beware of a charging porcupine at this site, but we didn’t see it. Good luck!”</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">Clearly tired and not paying close-enough attention, I hit my head hard on a downed white pine, felled by a chain saw, as I was pulling a canoe from the water. Within minutes, a bloody knot formed at my nonexistent hairline. Although it hurt, it could have been much worse, which put a bit of a scare into me — serious injuries out here have serious consequences. Aidan comforted me and continued to check my wound for the rest of the trip, which will remain a sweet memory for me.</p>

  <p class="Text_Body">The Border Route Hiking Trail, which follows close to the border over 65 miles, ran directly through our campsite, so we had various visitors throughout the afternoon and evening. A father and his two sons came through and told us that they’d heard grunting at their site the night before and awoke to find moose tracks around their tent. A solo hiker stopped briefly to chat — he was putting in some big miles to meet a friend for a canoe trip. Another hiker who looked woefully underprepared walked through with little more than a greeting. And at around 6 p.m., a somewhat bewildered grandfather and grandson stumbled into our camp asking where they could find a site for themselves. We encouraged them to consider a campsite on the Canadian side, but never encountered them again.</p>

  <p class="Text_Body">The wind was too daunting to paddle back down Rose, so we decided to forgo our plans for walleye fishing and a hike up Stairway Portage to look out over the palisades. “Things don’t always go your way out here,” I explained to Aidan, my head still throbbing. “You don’t get the site you want, the weather doesn’t cooperate, someone gets hurt. You’ve got to be flexible.”</p>
  <p class="Text_Body">We fished for smallmouth on our end of the lake, ate chicken stew and Oreo pie for dinner, and silently considered the Long Portage, the challenge that awaited us in the morning.</p>
