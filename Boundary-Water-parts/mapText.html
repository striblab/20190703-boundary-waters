Hed_Feat_80: Joys, challenges – and lessons – flow


Netheader: netheader goes here

Summary: Summary_Large_Whitman:  ► A five-day canoe trip through the eastern lakes of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness included a father bringing his son for the first time. The joys and challenges of adventure in the North Woods abound. The outing also covered part of a route — the Voyageur’s Highway — rich in history, in untouched natural beauty, and in lessons for future generations. ◄ Paddlers had reminders every day of eastern lakes’ history, diversity

Hed_PopHed_22: DAY 1 Gunflint Lake
Text_Info__NoIndent: About halfway between Rainy Lake and Lake Superior along the Voyageur’s Highway, ► Gunflint Lake ◄ the lake boasts the iconic Gunflint Lodge — launch spot for our group. Gunflint is named for deposits of chert, a 2-billion-year-old black rock that both Ojibwe Indians and Voyageurs used to spark their flintlock rifles. The Gunflint Trail, which runs northwest from Grand Marais, Minn., to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, takes its name from the lake.
Text_ChapterHead: Height of Land
Text_Info__NoIndent: An 80-rod (quarter-mile) portage between North and South lakes, Height of Land Portage is entry point No. 58 into the BWCA. It also stands on the Laurentian Divide, meaning that water to its north and west flows to Hudson Bay and water to its south and east flows to Lake Superior. First-time Voyageurs were baptized here, a tradition that our group continued when we arrived.

Hed_PopHed_22: DAY 2 Rose Lake
Text_Info__NoIndent:  The Voyageurs first called it Small Fish Lake for its quantity of suckers; then they named it Lac Roseau, meaning lake of reeds because of its shallowness. The French, however, was corrupted in translation to Rose Lake. Much of its shoreline burned in a 900-acre fire in 1936. Today it’s a popular lake for fishing, so popular that our group had a hard time finding a place to sleep.
Text_ChapterHead: Stairway Portage
Text_Info__NoIndent: As the name implies, this 80-rod portage is a wooden staircase — two actually, of more than 90 steps each. From Rose Lake to Duncan Lake, the stairs cover an elevation change of about 120 feet, and they parallel the pretty Rose Falls. Duncan Lake, with seven campsites, is known for great fishing.

Hed_PopHed_22: DAY 3 Long Portage
Text_Info__NoIndent: One of the longest portages in the BWCA, Long Portage stretches 660 rods (about 2 ¼ miles) between Rose and Rove lakes. Two-thirds of those rods follow the railroad grade laid in the 1920s by the General Logging Co., making for a relatively easy portage. But it’s still a long grind, as our group discovered over 90 minutes. 
Text_ChapterHead: Poses and pipes
Text_Info__NoIndent: Voyageurs didn’t measure their distances in miles or feet. They measured portages by “posés,” a posé being French for a spot where burdens are laid down. So a lengthy portage might have three or four resting spots, or posés. And on lakes, they paddled for 50 minutes per hour, stopping to smoke a pipe in the last 10 minutes. Thus, the length of a lake was measured in pipes.
Text_ChapterHead: Moose sighting
Text_Info__NoIndent: A cow moose and her calf were spotted on the Minnesota shore of Watap Lake — a reminder of their fragile existence and decling numbers in the state. The legislature recently funded research involving the University of Minnesota and multiple agencies, which will intensify the study of a brainworm parasite and its transmission from deer — lethal to moose.

Hed_PopHed_22: DAY 4 Mountain Lake
Text_Info__NoIndent: Mountain and Moose (deep and clear) and North and South Fowl lakes (shallow and murky) are linked by proximity but are a study in contrasts. The Fowl lakes are part of the Pigeon River Valley and, like Moose and Mountain lakes, framed by dramatic cliffs that make this part of border country so iconic.
Text_ChapterHead: Settlement artifacts
Text_Info__NoIndent: The BWCA is rife with historical artifacts. 
At some spots you can view railroad tracks — and in one lake a submerged steam engine ► ! ◄  — left by 19th-century loggers. Mysterious pictographs painted byAmerican Indians over 500 years ago can be viewed on several palisades. And on the shores of South Fowl Lake, archaeologists have discovered arrowheads dating back to 10,000 B.C. But remember, none of these can be removed from the BWCA.
Text_ChapterHead: Geographical wonder
Text_Info__NoIndent: The landscape of these eastern lakes was shaped by erosion over millions of years — hard layers forming the arresting cliffs, soft layers eroding and forming basins for the lakes. All of it started more than a billion years ago when the region was one big sea before the Rove Formation, producing a layer of gray, sedimentary rock for which Rove Lake is named.

Hed_PopHed_22: DAY 5 SOUTH FOWL LAKE
Text_Info__NoIndent: The South and North Fowl lakes are dotted with islands. Entering from Moose Lake and seeing cabins was a reminder that the the lakes fall outside the BWCA. The group’s final night was spent on a buggy island —appropriate on the swampy, shallow South Fowl.
Text_ChapterHead: Pigeon River
Text_Info__NoIndent: This river, one of the largest rivers in northern Minnesota and fed by lakes like Mountain to the west, was a key water trail for the Voyageurs plying their fur trade in the 18th and 19th centuries, and before that, indigenous people. The river’s legendary 9-mile “Grand Portage” stretches to Lake Superior.
Hed_PopHed_22: END Little John Lake
Text_Info__NoIndent: The journey had it all, a full BWCA 
experience in a short amount of time. 
The group put in the miles by paddle (nearly 43); portaged 12 times between 18 lakes of various sizes. Some, like Little Gunflint and Little North early in the trip, were but quiet respites between their bigger namesakes.
