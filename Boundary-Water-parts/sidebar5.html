<p class="Text_ChapterHead">The best moment?</p>
<p class="Text_Body_Ragged_NoIndent">The very end of the trip &mdash; we paddled around the corner of Little John Lake to see the boat ramp. It was the last stretch, and it hit me that the trip was over. I realized how far we had come and how much we had seen.</p>
<p class="Text_ChapterHead">His toughest moment?</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Probably after the massive 660-rod portage. I was so tired I thought I could not keep going. But after a short break we were paddling. I had no choice but to keep going if we wanted to get to a good campsite before it was taken.</p>
<p class="Text_ChapterHead">His most memorable moment?</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Definitely the first night: I was catching a smallmouth bass every cast!</p>
<p class="Text_ChapterHead">Being offline?</p>
<p class="Text_Body">It was weird not having any tech or any way to contact anyone. But after a couple of days I started to appreciate it and not think about it. This made the trip way more enjoyable.</p>
<p class="Text_ChapterHead">Finish this sentence: I&rsquo;ll never forget when ...</p>
<p class="Text_Body">We decided to go to the Pigeon River Dam. It took about a half-hour of climbing very rough terrain to get to the waterfall. It was worth it.</p></div>
