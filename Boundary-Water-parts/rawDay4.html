<p class="drop-caps Text_Body">The ankle-deep mud on Lesser Cherry Portage foretold a change. We’d awoken in our beautiful campsite on Mountain Lake, where even the biffy was memorable, nestled in a spruce glade, dappled with sunlight. We fried donuts over the fire and devoured hashbrowns and powdered eggs. Today was going to be a long paddle, and we donned extra layers against the morning’s gray chill and light rain. It was Day 4 for our group of five.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Five miles down Mountain, we disembarked for the first of a series of three portages (Lesser Cherry, Vaseux, and Greater Cherry) and two lakes (Fan and Vaseux), neither of which was much more than a beaver pond. My son Aidan carried a canoe for the first time, taking the 55-pound three-person craft onto his shoulders for a 90-rod portage. “Way harder than a portage pack,” he told me when I asked how it went. </p>
<p class="Text_Body">We paddled the 3.5 miles of Moose Lake, clear and blue like Mountain. Then we traversed Moose Portage, the sloppiest of our trip — I almost broke my ankle stepping into an unseen hole beneath a puddle. Behind us lay the abysses of Mountain (210 feet) and Moose (113 feet), and ahead of us the shallows of North and South Fowl lakes. Maximum depth: 10 feet.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Named for its abundance of ducks and geese, South Fowl Lake riffles with history. Plano projectile points made from jasper, dating to around 10,000 B.C., have been found on its shores, as have polished copper artifacts, suggesting that our canoe routes were inaugurated by Native Americans in dugout canoes around 3000 B.C.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">More recently, South Fowl Lake boasted Fort Charlotte, built by the North West Company in 1779. At the end of a winter of trapping and trading, Voyageurs left their canoes at Fort Charlotte and packed the furs they acquired across the 9-mile Grand Portage, running along the rapids and waterfalls of the Pigeon River out to Lake Superior. There they loaded their bounty into larger Montreal canoes for the journey through the Great Lake and eventual export to Europe.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Our canoes glided into South Fowl, but the lake vexed us. We’d had a virtually island-free journey, and now we gazed across a constellation of islands and wondered which hosted our desired campsite. We pulled our canoes together, looked at the map, looked at the islands, and looked at our map again. Ultimately, we paddled around, sometimes covering the same water twice, until spying a narrow channel between a muskeg bog and an island. Following the straits, we skirted the atoll and found our campsite.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">We suspected that this shallow, marshy lake would be buggy. We weren’t wrong. Aaron Lavinsky, a Star Tribune photojournalist in our group, sauntered away to the latrine, only to come running back moments later. “You will not believe the mosquitoes back there,” he gasped. “I’ve never heard anything like it!”</p>
<p class="Text_Body">We could believe it, because they’d found us, too. We started a smoky fire to keep the bugs at bay and discussed our options as we ate our fourth salami-and-cheese lunch of the trip. We decided to stay because the map showed only one other campsite on the lake, and it would be just as buggy. I commiserated with John Bigsby, who traveled on this lake in 1823 as part of a British commission to determine the borders and wrote in his diary, “The mosquitoes were in the billions. As soon as the tread of man gave notice of his approach, I saw them rising to feast.”</p>
<p class="Text_Body">With darkening skies to our west, we made an early dinner of burritos, washed our dishes in the rain, and retreated to our tents for late-afternoon naps and reading. I’d brought newsman Eric Sevareid’s famous “Canoeing with the Cree,” a true tale of his paddle with a teenaged buddy 2,250 miles from Minneapolis to Hudson Bay in 1930. I read aloud to anyone within earshot this pertinent passage: “It was queer that so many people saw only the hardships and discomforts of our trip. No one seemed to realize what great sport it was.”</p>
<p class="Text_Body">The clouds hung leaden and unsettled after the storm passed. We decided to make an evening dash to the dam that sits at the intersection where South Fowl drains into the Pigeon River. I’d heard that the walleye fishing was good in the pool above the dam, and that species had eluded us thus far. “Walleye is the one fish that doesn’t jump in your boat up here,” chided my buddy Brad Shannon.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">We shoved off around 7 p.m, knowing that we had about two hours before dark for the roundtrip. The wind whipped across the shallow lake, and within a few minutes I regretted this excursion. We’d already paddled over 12 miles on that, our fourth day, and I worried about Aidan’s endurance, in the bow of the 3-man canoe.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">As we approached the dam, a large, foreboding red sign came into focus: </p>
<p class="Text_Body">DANGER </p>
<p class="Text_Body">Fast Water — Keep Away </p>
<p class="Text_Body">Courant rapide — Ne pas approacher</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Bob Timmons and I guided our canoe to shore, well short of the dam, and Brad brought the other vessel in not far from us. We grabbed our fishing rods and casted from shore for several minutes with nary a bite. Frustrated with fishing, Aidan said he wanted to see the rapids beneath the dam. </p>
<p class="Text_Body">We’d beached on the American shore, along a steep jumble of loose granite scree covered thick with lichen, and slippery. Slowly, we picked our way along the rocks with the roar of unseen whitewater beckoning us onward. Upon reaching the rock-and-concrete dam, built in 1958, we beheld the tumultuous rapids, which flow aggressively toward Lake Superior, where they cascade over the 120 feet of High Falls in Grand Portage, the biggest waterfall in Minnesota.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">“It’s time to go back,” Brad said after just a couple minutes. The clamber back to the canoes seemed even more treacherous since my legs and my nerves were both frayed. Bob and I were paddling hard into the wind without talking when I noticed that the water sloshing in the bottom of the canoe was turning pink. Blood dripped from a two-inch gash on the leg of my yellow Labrador retriever Crosby. He must have cut it on the sharp granite that we struggled over near the dam, I thought. Now, this excursion seemed even more foolhardy.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">Back at camp, by the light of headlamps, we took supplies from the first aid kit and cleaned and dressed the wound. Crosby wasn’t favoring that leg, so I hoped that the injury was only superficial. Nevertheless, I regretted taking him on those rocks.</p>
<p class="Text_Body">In our tent that night, with Crosby shivering between us, Brad and I talked about the calculated risk you take whenever you head into the wilderness, far from phones and doctors (and veterinarians). But we agreed: Adventure is worth the risk.</p>
