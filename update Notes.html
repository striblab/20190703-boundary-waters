LCD: 510082251

I have a folder inside of 20190703-boundary-waters called Boundary-Water-parts 
• rawDay2.html file that has rough copy and strib tags for day 2
• BW TopLCD.html - see below

run gulp inside 20190703-boundary-waters


Update Nav for part 2 whenever story and sidebar are through slot.

	1. Open  _nav.scss and search for BILLY STEVE	
	2 spots to change: lines 289 and 308
	will then need to be put into S3 with:  gulp publish --production


	2. open BW TopLCD.html and search for BILLY STEVE
	line 57
	will then need to be put into LCD 510082251. - Top Nav



sidebar tips

sidebars need to be wrapped in <div class="sidebar storyBlock">
and <p class="drop-caps Text_Body"> needs to be dropped in for first paragraph.

make sure sidebar has associated image and caption
